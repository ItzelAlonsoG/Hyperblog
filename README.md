**What is github?**
> At a higher level, GitHub is a website and cloud service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as keep track of and control any changes to this code. To understand exactly what GitHub is, you first need to know the two principles that connect it:
> - Version control
> - Git

# Git concepts

**Working directory**
> This is where we can make any changes and not affect our repository at all. As soon as we modify something in our code, it has the status of modified. If we run the git status command, it will show us which files have been modified (or created).

**Staging index**
> This is where we can name our new version. And create a "copy" of how our repository would be in production. To pass our staging area code to the Git Repository (the code has not yet been published on Github).

**Local repository**
> When we talk about a local repository, we refer to the changes, repositories and branches that are on our computer, which are not in the cloud or a remote repository.

**Remote repository**
> Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or on any other network. You can have several of them, and in each one you will generally have read-only or read and write permissions.
